    <h1 class="mainfont">About Me</h1>
    
    <p id="p_about" class="mainfont">
        I've always been interested in tech, computing, and gaming; I'm passionate about finding novel and efficient solutions to problems.
        <br>
        <br>
        When I decided to change careers, software was a natural choice as it allowed me to match those interests.
        <br>
        <br>
        I've learned more than I thought possible in Code Nation's Computer Science bootcamp, and I'm excited to work in the tech industry.
